# Graph Feature

Use the interactive graph view to visualize relationships between your notes, characters, and story elements. You can:

- Click nodes and edges to navigate between related items.
- Filter and highlight by tags, types, or relationships to focus on specific connections.
- Zoom, pan, and adjust layout for large graphs.
- Use contextual actions (create, edit, link) directly from the graph interface.
