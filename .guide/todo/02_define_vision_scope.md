# Define Project Vision & Scope

Document the overall vision, goals, and scope of the project. Include target audience, key features, and what is out of scope.

**Why:** Clear vision and scope prevent feature creep and keep the team aligned.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Vision and goals are documented and agreed upon.
- Scope boundaries are clear.
- Stakeholders have reviewed and approved the document.
