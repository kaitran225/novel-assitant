# Plan UX/UI Wireframes

Sketch wireframes or mockups for key screens (dashboard, editor, board, agent panel). Map user journeys and accessibility considerations.

**Why:** Early wireframes help clarify requirements and catch usability issues before development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Wireframes/mockups for all major screens.
- User journeys mapped.
- Accessibility guidelines noted.
