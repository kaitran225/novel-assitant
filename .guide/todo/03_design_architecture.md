# Design High-Level Architecture

Create an architecture diagram and describe the main components (UI, API, backend, agent, AI integration). Justify tech choices and outline data flow.

**Why:** A clear architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and easier onboarding for new contributors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Architecture diagram is created and reviewed.
- Tech stack and data flow are documented.
- Risks and alternatives are considered.
