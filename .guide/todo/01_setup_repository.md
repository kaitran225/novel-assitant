# Set Up Project Repository

Create a new git repository for the project. Initialize with a README, .gitignore, and LICENSE. Set up the main branch and push to a remote (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

**Why:** Version control is essential for collaboration, tracking changes, and maintaining code quality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Repository exists and is accessible to the team.
- README, .gitignore, and LICENSE are present.
- Main branch is protected (if using a remote).
