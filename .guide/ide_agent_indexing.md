# IDE Agent & Project Indexing

The app includes an IDE Agent-like feature inspired by tools such as Cursor:

- Scans and indexes all files in your project (notes, character sheets, outlines, etc.).
- Builds a searchable index of your story universe, characters, and plot points.
- Uses the index to provide smart suggestions for storylines, plot development, and character arcs.
- Allows the AI to answer questions about your project, find inconsistencies, and suggest improvements.
- All indexing and analysis is performed locally for privacy and speed.

This feature helps you manage large projects, keep track of details, and get creative suggestions from the AI based on your entire project context.
