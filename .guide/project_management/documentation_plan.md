# Documentation Plan

This plan ensures all user and developer documentation is comprehensive, up-to-date, and enterprise-ready.

## Documentation Types
- **User Guides:** Step-by-step instructions, FAQs, and troubleshooting for end users.
- **Developer Docs:** API references, architecture, onboarding, and code standards.
- **Admin/IT Docs:** Deployment, integration, and security guides for enterprise IT.

## Tools & Platforms
- Markdown for all docs (stored in `.guide/`)
- Diagrams via Mermaid or Figma
- API docs via OpenAPI/Swagger
- Internal wiki for enterprise customers (optional)

## Maintenance
- Docs updated with every major feature or release
- PRs require doc updates for new features/changes
- Quarterly doc reviews for accuracy and completeness

## Access & Distribution
- Docs bundled with app releases
- Public docs on GitHub (user/dev)
- Private docs for enterprise (admin/IT)

## Ownership
- Each team (frontend, backend, AI, IT) owns their section
- Doc lead coordinates reviews and updates
