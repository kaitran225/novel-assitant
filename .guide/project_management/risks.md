# Risks

## Key Risks
- **AI Model Drift:** LLMs may generate inconsistent or off-brand content over time.
- **Data Privacy:** Sensitive user data must be protected at all times.
- **Scalability:** High user or data volume may impact performance.
- **Integration Complexity:** Supporting many plugins and enterprise systems increases risk.
- **Compliance:** Failure to meet GDPR, CCPA, or other regulations.
- **User Adoption:** Users may resist new workflows or tools.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Regular model evaluation and fine-tuning
- End-to-end encryption and strict access controls
- Load testing and horizontal scaling
- Modular, well-documented integration APIs
- Ongoing compliance audits and legal review
- User training, onboarding, and feedback loops
