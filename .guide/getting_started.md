# Getting Started

## Ollama Installation & Setup

To use AI features in this app, you must install Ollama (the local AI engine) separately:

1. Download Ollama from the official website: https://ollama.com/download
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
3. After installation, launch Ollama. It will run as a background service on your computer.
4. Download and set up your preferred AI model (e.g., Llama, Mistral) using the Ollama interface or command line.
5. Ensure Ollama is running before starting the Novel Assistant app. The app will connect to Ollamaâ€™s local API (usually http://localhost:11434) to provide AI-powered features.

If Ollama is not running, AI features will be unavailable. For troubleshooting, see the Ollama documentation or check that the service is active.

1. Set up the Flutter app scaffold for desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux).
2. Implement the Markdown editor for writing using Flutter widgets.

4. Build the board feature for story planning.
5. Add the graph view for note relationships.
6. Create the plugin API for extensibility (using Dart/Flutter).
