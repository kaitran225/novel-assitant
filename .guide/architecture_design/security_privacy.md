# Security & Privacy

## Enterprise Security & Privacy Principles

- **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted at rest (Hive, SQLite) and in transit (HTTPS).
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) for users and admins.
- **Audit Logging:** All critical actions are logged for compliance and traceability.
- **Data Residency:** Supports on-premises and cloud deployment to meet enterprise data residency requirements.
- **Privacy by Design:** No user data leaves the enterprise environment unless explicitly exported by the user.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Regular security reviews, dependency scanning, and patching.
- **Compliance:** Designed to support GDPR, CCPA, and other major privacy regulations.
