# Enterprise Deployment Guide

## Supported Environments

- Windows, macOS, Linux (desktop client)
- On-premises, private cloud, or hybrid
- Backend can run on Docker, Kubernetes, or bare metal

## Steps

1. **Prepare Infrastructure:**
   - Provision VMs or containers for backend and agent services.
   - Set up secure networking (VPN, firewalls, HTTPS).
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Ollama, SQLite/Postgres, Hive, Flutter SDK.
   - Use requirements.txt and Dockerfiles for reproducibility.
3. **Configure Environment:**
   - Set environment variables for DB, API keys, and secrets.
   - Configure JWT secret, allowed origins, and logging.
4. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Use Docker Compose or Helm charts for orchestration.
   - Expose API via HTTPS with valid certificates.
5. **Deploy Frontend:**
   - Build Flutter desktop binaries for each OS.
   - Distribute via enterprise software management tools (Intune, Jamf, SCCM).
6. **Monitoring & Updates:**
   - Integrate with monitoring/logging tools.
   - Set up CI/CD for automated builds and updates.

## Security Checklist

- All secrets managed via vault (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Regular vulnerability scans and patching
- Penetration testing before production rollout
