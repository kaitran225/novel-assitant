# Scalability & Enterprise Readiness

## Horizontal & Vertical Scaling
- Backend (FastAPI) supports horizontal scaling via containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
- Stateless API design enables load balancing and failover.
- Database (SQLite for local, Postgres for enterprise deployments) can be swapped for cloud DBs.
- AI/agent modules can be distributed across nodes for high-availability.

## Multi-Tenancy
- Supports single-tenant (local) and multi-tenant (enterprise) modes.
- Tenant isolation via separate DB schemas or containers.
- Role-based access and data partitioning for compliance.

## Monitoring & Observability
- Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for metrics.
- Centralized logging (ELK stack, Loki, or cloud logging).
- Health checks and alerting for all services.

## Disaster Recovery
- Automated backups (DB, config, user data).
- Restore procedures documented and tested.
- Versioned deployments for rollback.

## Compliance
- GDPR, CCPA, SOC2 readiness.
- Data retention and deletion policies.
- Full audit trails for all user and admin actions.
