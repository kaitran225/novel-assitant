# Persona Logic

Personas enable the AI agent to adapt its behavior, tone, and expertise for different users, teams, or writing tasks.

## Persona Definition

- Each persona is defined by a set of attributes:
  - Name, description, writing style, expertise (e.g., "Worldbuilding Expert", "Dialogue Coach")
  - Custom prompt templates and response strategies
  - Access permissions and allowed actions

## Persona Management

- Personas are stored as structured data (YAML, JSON, or DB records)
- Admins can create, edit, or remove personas via a management UI or config files
- Personas can be assigned to users, teams, or specific projects
- Supports persona versioning and audit trails

## Persona Usage

- Agent selects persona based on user, context, or explicit command
- Persona influences LLM prompts, suggestions, and agent actions
- Supports multi-persona collaboration (e.g., two agents with different roles on the same project)

## Enterprise Features

- Role-based persona access (only certain users can use or manage specific personas)
- Persona usage is logged for compliance
- Supports custom enterprise personas for business-specific workflows
