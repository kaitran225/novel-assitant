The enterprise AI agent supports a wide range of advanced capabilities to assist writers and teams:

## Core Capabilities
- **Context-Aware Suggestions:** Provides plot, character, and style suggestions based on the entire project context.

- **Task Automation:** Automates repetitive tasks (e.g., updating character sheets, generating summaries).
- **Natural Language Commands:** Accepts and executes user instructions in plain English.
- **File & Metadata Management:** Reads, writes, and organizes project files, notes, and metadata.
- **Plugin/Extension Support:** Loads new agent skills and tools via plugins.

## Enterprise Features
