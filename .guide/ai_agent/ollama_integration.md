# Ollama Integration

Ollama is integrated as the local LLM (large language model) engine for all AI-powered features in the enterprise app.

## Architecture
- Ollama runs as a local service (default: http://localhost:11434).
- The backend (FastAPI) communicates with Ollama via REST API calls.
- Agent orchestrator manages all LLM requests, batching, and context passing.

## Features
- Supports multiple LLMs (Llama, Mistral, etc.) for different agent skills.
- Handles prompt engineering, context injection, and output parsing.
- Can run multiple models in parallel for specialized tasks (e.g., lore checking, dialogue generation).

## Security
- All API calls to Ollama are local and never leave the enterprise environment.
- Access to Ollama is restricted to authorized backend services.
- Model downloads and updates are managed by IT/admins.

## Monitoring & Performance
- Logs all LLM requests and responses for audit and debugging.
- Monitors resource usage (CPU, RAM, GPU) and alerts on overload.
- Supports model hot-swapping and rolling updates.

## Compliance
- All LLM usage is logged for compliance.
- Models can be fine-tuned on enterprise/private data for better results.
