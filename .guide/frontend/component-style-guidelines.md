# Component Style Guidelines

- Use CSS variables for all color and spacing values.
- Prefer functional, stateless components for UI.
- Use BEM or another naming convention for class names.
- Keep component styles modular and colocated.
- Use utility classes for layout and spacing.
- Document any custom styles in the component's README or comments.
